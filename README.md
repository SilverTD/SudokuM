# SudokuM v1.3
## About
- Sudoku is a great thinking puzzle game, but it's even better when it's an online game like that you can play with friends while away from each other.
- The game uses ``HTML`` / ``CSS`` / ``JS`` and uses ``PUBNUB`` for the server.
- I originally made this game mainly to play with my sister (when my sister was away).
- But later on i develop it further to play with my foreign friends.

## Rules

- Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square.
- If the player enters the correct number, 1 point will be added, otherwise if the player is incorrect, 3 points will be deducted.
- The person with the highest score wins.
